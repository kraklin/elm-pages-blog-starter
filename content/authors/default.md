# Hi there!

## I'm Professor Franklin Frisby. 

Pleased to make your acquaintance. We'll be spending some time together, as I'm supposed to teach you a bit about functional programming.

I won't assume that you have any previous functional programming knowledge, because we both know what happens when you assume. 

I will, however, expect you to have run into some of the _unfavorable situations_ that arise when working with **mutable state**, **unrestricted side effects**, and **unprincipled design**. 

Now that we've been properly introduced, let's get on with it.
